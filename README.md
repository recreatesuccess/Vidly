# Vidly

Vidly is an imaginary service for renting out movies. Interesting and useful functionality will be added periodically to this repository.

On November 22, 2019, connection to MongoDB was enabled. This project is deepening my understanding of Non-Relational databases. 
The single responsibility principle was put in action today, and the structure of the application has been modified and modularized to ensure maintainability.
